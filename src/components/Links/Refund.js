Thank you for your generous donation to Swami Vivekanand Medical Mission-Wayand (SVMM-Wayand). We deeply appreciate your support in our mission to serve the community. Please find below our policy regarding refunds and cancellations for donations made through our website using credit or debit cards: 
<br />
<br/>
<b>No Refunds Policy </b>
<br />
We accept donations on a "no refunds" basis. Once a donation is made, it cannot be refunded except under the specific circumstances outlined below. 
<br />
<b>Refunds Due to Mistakes 
 </b>
<br />


We understand that errors may occur during the donation process, such as accidental double donations or entering an incorrect amount. 

In such cases, it is our policy to provide a refund upon request within 7 days of making the donation. 

To request a refund, please send a written request to SVMM-Wayand via email at contact@svmmkerala.org to our official address. Your request must include: 

   - Proof of the deduction of the donation amount. 

   - For donations where a receipt has already been issued, the original receipt must be returned to our office addresses. 

 If a tax exemption certificate has already been issued for the donation, we regret that we will not be able to process the refund. However, if the refund request is due to an error on SVMM-Wayand part, we will refund the donation and bear the associated costs. 
 <br />
<b>Refunds for Cancelled Events 

 </b>
<br />

Refunds for event registrations will only be issued in the case of cancelled events. In such instances, Youth for Seva will process the refund automatically to the original payment method. 
<br />
<b>International Donations 

 </b>
<br />


Please note that international donations may require a minimum of 15 days for the refund process to be completed due to additional processing time.
